# Nudge Demo Video Script
**Target Length:** 2-3 minutes
**For:** Moltiverse Hackathon Submission

---

## INTRO (0:00-0:15)
**[SCREEN: Landing page hero]**

> "Meet Nudge — your AI-powered wellness companion with a twist. Instead of one-size-fits-all advice, Nudge gives you access to a marketplace of specialized AI agents, powered by x402 micropayments."

---

## SECTION 1: The Problem (0:15-0:30)
**[SCREEN: Scroll through landing page features]**

> "Wellness apps today are either too generic or too expensive. You pay monthly subscriptions for features you don't use. Nudge flips this — pay only for the conversations you have, with agents that specialize in exactly what you need."

---

## SECTION 2: iOS App Walkthrough (0:30-1:15)
**[SCREEN: iOS app - Goals tab]**

> "The native iOS app connects to your HealthKit data. Set personalized goals — steps, outdoor time, mindfulness minutes. Track your progress with beautiful visualizations."

**[SCREEN: iOS app - Timeline tab]**

> "Your wellness timeline shows daily check-ins, mood tracking, and activity summaries. Every check-in earns you $NUDGE tokens."

**[SCREEN: iOS app - Chat tab]**

> "Chat with AI agents directly from your phone. The free Nudge Coach handles general wellness questions..."

**[SCREEN: iOS app - Wallet tab]**

> "Your embedded Privy wallet holds $NUDGE tokens. No seed phrases, no complexity — just sign in with email and you're ready."

---

## SECTION 3: Agent Marketplace (1:15-1:45)
**[SCREEN: Web dashboard - /marketplace]**

> "The marketplace is where it gets interesting. Browse specialized agents — fitness coaches, meditation guides, nutrition experts, sleep specialists."

**[SCREEN: Click on a paid agent]**

> "Premium agents cost $NUDGE tokens per message. This uses x402 — the new HTTP payment standard. Your request includes a payment proof, verified on-chain before the agent responds."

**[SCREEN: Show agent categories/search]**

> "Filter by category, search for specific expertise. And here's the magic..."

---

## SECTION 4: Agent-Creating-Agent (1:45-2:15)
**[SCREEN: /submit-agent page]**

> "Anyone can submit an agent — including other AI agents. This form accepts a $0.10 listing fee via x402."

**[SCREEN: Show Skynet Junior in marketplace]**

> "We tested this by having our AI create 'Skynet Junior' — an agent that was submitted programmatically through the API. Agents creating agents, paying each other in crypto. This is the autonomous agent economy."

---

## SECTION 5: The Token (2:15-2:30)
**[SCREEN: Token section on landing page]**

> "$NUDGE is live on Monad testnet. Earn tokens for daily check-ins and streaks. Spend them on premium agents. The circular economy keeps users engaged and agents incentivized."

---

## OUTRO (2:30-2:45)
**[SCREEN: Landing page CTA section]**

> "Nudge combines native iOS, AI agents, x402 micropayments, and on-chain verification into one seamless wellness experience. Download on TestFlight, try the web dashboard, or check out the code on GitHub."
